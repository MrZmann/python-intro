Implement the following files (see comments within each file 
for a more detailed explanation):

- basics.py
- files.py
- client.py

In order to test your work:

- python <program_name>

For client.py, you will first need to run server.py. 
You can simply open a new tab of wsl2, run server.py in that window
and then run client.py in your original window. Keep in mind the 
server might die and you will have to start it up again. Also note
that server.py requires you to supply an argument. Try to find out
what to do by reading the error messages or taking a look into 
server.py.

Once you are done, commit your code and push it to Github Classroom.
